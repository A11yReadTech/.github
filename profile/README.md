## [APCA GUIDELINES FOR READABLE DESIGN](https://www.readtech.org/ARG/)

Welcome to Inclusive Reading Technologies. We are a nonprofit dedicated to improving accessibility and visual readability, and home to the [APCA Readability Criterion](https://readtech.org/ARC/).

The APCA Readability Criterion (ARC) provide recommendations for making visual content on self-illuminated displays more accessible to all users, especially those with visual impairments.


## _Guidelines Discussions Forum_
- [**We have this forum**](https://github.com/orgs/A11yReadTech/discussions) for discussing the draft guidelines for design and visual accessibility.

- For Theory & Math Discussions please see [SAPC-APCA Discussions Forum](https://github.com/Myndex/SAPC-APCA/discussions), which has many discussions surrounding the underlying theories of perceptually uniform contrast, and the actual algorithm, code libraries, and math.


### About APCA
Essential knowledge regarding the Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm.
- The [**APCA Linktree**](https://linktr.ee/Myndex), a list of essential resources.
- The [**APCA Easy Intro**](https://git.apcacontrast.com/documentation/APCAeasyIntro), a basic plain language quickstart.
