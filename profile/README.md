## [APCA GUIDELINES FOR READABLE DESIGN](https://www.readtech.org/ARG/guidelines/)

Welcome to Accessible Reading Technologies. We are a nonprofit dedicated to improving accessibility and visual readability, and home to the APCA Readability Guidelines.

The APCA Readability Guidelines (ARG) provide recommendations for making visual content on self-illuminated displays more accessible to all users, especially those with visual impairments.
